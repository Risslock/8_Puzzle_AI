Project to solve the N_Puzzle problem

Hi Risslock here! I'm a mechatronic engineer with a master in optomechatronics. But currently I'm interested in doing AI projects!! So let start with it!!


This first project is about search algorithms to solve the N puzzle problem. We will be trying breath first, depth first, A* and Iterative deepening A* searches.
